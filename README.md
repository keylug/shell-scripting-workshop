## Shell scripting workshop
Fork this repo by click on the Fork icon in the upper right corner.  Once forked
you will be able to add the code you want to demo.

Do so by running the following commands:
> $ git checkout -b feature-name

> $ git add /path/to/script

> $ git commit -m 'commit message'

> $ git push --set-upstream origin feature-name

Once you have your scripts in the repo create a pull request back to this repo 
and we will add it back in as well as make you a member of the KeyLUG org.
